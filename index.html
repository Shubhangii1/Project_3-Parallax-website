        <h2>Section one</h2>
        <p>Parallax scrolling is a computer graphics technique used by web designers to create a faux-3D effect. As users scroll down a webpage, different layers of content or backgrounds move at different speeds, and this creates an optical illusion. Using parallax scrolling is not a new technique. In the early 1980s, game designers working on Super Mario Bros. used parallax graphics to create a sensation of depth. 

            Today, parallax scrolling has become more of a trend in the web design world—and for good reason. Scrolling is easier than clicking, and a well-designed parallax effect engages users to scroll for more information.</p>

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p>There are a few different ways designers can create parallax website designs. The first is to dive into pure CSS to create it. If you want to follow this approach, you should use a container element and add a background image to this container. Then you should use the “background-attachment: fixed” CSS property to create the actual parallax effect. You can find a working example at W3Schools.

            Another approach is to use website builders to add parallax scrolling. Website builders like Wix, Elementor, or Squarespace allow you to create a parallax effect with minimal effort.</p>

        <p>It helps tell a story
            Parallax graphics are ideal for storytelling. Good design is all about communication—and when we design websites, we want to communicate with our visitors and tell a compelling story about our product, service, or brand. Parallax scrolling allows us to immerse our website visitors in unique online experiences. It’s even possible to create a one-page website where visitors can read an entire story about your product or brand without navigating to multiple pages.
            
            It helps to improve user engagement
            Parallax graphics can be used to improve user engagement. Reducing your website’s bounce rate is one of the goals to be conscientious of in web design. Bounce rate measures the percentage of site visitors who either hit the “back” button or close the tab after checking just one page of your website. High bounce rates hurt your search ranking, so any actions you can take to bring that rate down are worthwhile. A well-crafted parallax page gives the user the type of dynamic experience that tends to keep them on the page longer.</p>
